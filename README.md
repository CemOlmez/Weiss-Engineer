## Overview

Designed and developed my first landing page for Weiss Construction using HTML and CSS, replicating a layout from Figma. This project focused on honing my skills in web design, as I aimed to accurately translate the designer's vision into a functional webpage. While the layout is not responsive due to the absence of a mobile design in the original mockup, it served as valuable hands-on experience in HTML and CSS for me.


### The challenge

- Recreate the Figma design accurately in code.
- Develop a clean, visually consistent landing page.
- Navigate HTML/CSS complexities without a mobile layout.
